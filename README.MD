# Telegram bot template
My aim with this project is to develop an interesting telegram bot, one with modular functionalities that can be added or removed of the project at will, while also practing python and design patterns.
The goal is to add features that are interesting or fun to thave on your groups, while not having heavy maintenance with the bot.

## Added Features

Right now the soundfinder is working, but still not 100%. A new implementation is being tested.
